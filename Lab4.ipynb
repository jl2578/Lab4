    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will explore how twin data can be used to estimate genetic influence on behavior, and we’ll apply probability concepts to interpret these patterns. Our dataset is a synthetic ABCD dataset **(sample is 12 years old)**, we will\\ work with a subsample of **twin pairs**, using their zygosity (monozygotic vs. dizygotic) to infer heritability. We’ll also incorporate **family history** measures (e.g. parental substance problems) as a proxy for inherited risk, and examine how an **environmental factor** (household income) might modify these risks. Along the way, we’ll practice calculating probabilities and conditional probabilities (e.g. “Given one twin has a trait, what’s the probability the co-twin has it?”) and even try a short **Bayes’ Theorem** exercise as an extension. \n"

    "This comes out to roughly **0.19**, or **19%**. In other words, even though kids with family history are more likely to drink, fewer than 1 in 5 of the kids who have taken a drink come from a family with alcohol problems. Most (81%) of the early drinkers do *not* have a family history of alcohol issues.\n",

    "Why is P(FH | use) relatively low? Because family history, while a risk factor, is relatively uncommon (only ~15% of families had that history) and plenty of kids without family history also experiment with alcohol (making up the majority of the 33% who tried it). This demonstrates an important principle of probability and screening: **a risk factor can greatly increase relative risk, but if the base rate of the risk factor is low, the majority of individuals displaying the behavior might still come from the low-risk group**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical terms, if a 10-year-old has had a sip of alcohol, we **should not assume** their parents have alcohol problems – the probability is still far from certain (only ~19%). Conversely, if a child has no family history, they’re *less* likely to drink early, but because they form a large group, they still account for many of the cases who do drink. This is an example of how we use Bayes’ theorem to **invert conditional probabilities** and why we must consider base rates when interpreting risk indicators.\n"
